## The Loan Default Predictor project involved analyzing a dataset to predict loan defaults. Key steps included:

- **Data Loading and Cleaning:** Imported necessary libraries and datasets, examined the data structure, and cleaned the data by addressing missing values and verifying data types.

- **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA):** Performed EDA to understand the distribution of variables, identify trends, and detect anomalies. Analyzed relationships between various features and loan default status.

- **Model Building:** Used machine learning algorithms to build predictive models. Evaluated model performance using metrics like accuracy, precision, recall, and F1-score.
